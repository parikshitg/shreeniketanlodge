	 The most vivid travel experiences usually find you by accident, and the qualities that will make you fall in love with a place are rarely the features that took you there, but the essence itself…..Paradise found….. Tucked away in the foothills of the Himalays this heaven could well be described as the Garden of Eden.

Shreeniketan Lodge is an ideal place to enjoy a peaceful vacation in Kalimpong. You’ll wake up to the singing of birds every morning. Situated approximately 500 meters from the main town, which can be easily covered on foot,Shreeniketan Lodge offers 2 triple-bed rooms, 7 double-bed rooms and a single 4-bed room with all modern, essential amenities.
